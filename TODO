* Finish downloading RNA-Seq data
* Finish and publish an API
* Refine study search - add "Advanced" with platform type and study ID
* Make gene table sortable with javascript
* Add links from gene table to relevant search results
* Add widgets to adjust significance thresholds

Meta-analysis (by rank) for a query -- what's the number one gene that goes up? etc
Look for a journal home - find an article that's similar
**Look for genes unique to a virus**
Try aggregating by cell type instead of virus
Try scaling up-regulated and down-regulated genes separately rather than ranking all of them
Consider only significant genes (set fold change to zero for non-significant)
