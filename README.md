# Snappy Name

This repository houses the currently unnamed web app that will provide a frontend to my GEO curation results, which identified RNA-Seq/microarray experiments featuring virus infection of human cells.  It was built in Flask, which means it is (should be?) a WSGI app.  More extensive notes to come when I figure out what I'm doing
